### <div align="center"> TUTORIAL 1
  
1.Write the definition of a class Telephone that contains:
<br/>• An instance variable areaCode
<br/>• An instance variable number
<br/>• A static variable numberOfTelephoneObject that keeps track of the number of Telephone objects created
<br/>• A constructor that accepts two arguments used to initialize the two instance variables
<br/>• The accessor and mutator methods for areaCode and number
<br/>• A method makeFullNumber that does not accept any argument, concatenates areaCode and number with a dash in between, and returns the resultant String.
<br/>Write the statements to:
<br/>• Instantiate 5 Telephone objects and store them in an array. Iterate through the array to print the full number of the 5 Telephone objects on the console.
Your output should look as below:

```
03-79676300
03-79676301
03-79676302
03-79676303
03-79676304
```
Answer:
```java
public class Telephone {
    private String areaCode;
    private String number;
    private static int numberOfTelephoneObject = 0;

    public Telephone(String areaCode, String number){
        this.number = number;
        this.areaCode = areaCode;
    }
    public String getAreaCode() {
        return areaCode;
    }
    public void setAreaCode(String areaCode) {
        this.areaCode = areaCode;
    }
    public String getNumber() {
        return number;
    }
    public void setNumber(String number) {
        this.number = number;
    }
    public String makeFullNumber() {
        return areaCode + " - " + number;
    }
    public static int getNumberOfTelephoneObject() {
        return numberOfTelephoneObject;
    }
}
```
```java
public class TelephoneMain {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Telephone[] tele = new Telephone[5];

        for (int i = 0; i < tele.length; i++) {
            String areaCode = "03";
            String number = "7967630" + i;
            tele[i] = new Telephone(areaCode, number);
        }
        for (Telephone telephone : tele) {
            System.out.println(telephone.makeFullNumber());
        }
    }
}
```
<br/>2. What is the output for the following? Explain.
```java
class Person {
    public Person() {
        System.out.println("(1) Performs Person's tasks");
    }
}
class Employee extends Person {
    public Employee() {
        this("(2) Invoke Employee's overloaded constructor");
        System.out.println("(3) Performs Employee's tasks");
    }

    public Employee(String s) {
        System.out.println(s);
    }
}
    class Faculty extends Employee {
    public Faculty() {
        System.out.println("(4) Performs Faculty's tasks");
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new Faculty();
    }
}
```
Answer:
```
The output is:
(1) Performs Person's tasks
(2) Invoke Employee's overloaded constructor
(3) Performs Employee's tasks
(4) Performs Faculty's tasks

The 'main()' method is called, creating a new 'Faculty' object.
The 'Faculty' constructor is then called which also calls the 'Employee' constructor.
The 'Employee' constructor is with the String parameter is called, which then prints the '(2) Invoke Employee's overloaded constructor'.
The 'Employee' constructor then calls the 'Person' constructors, printing '(1) Performs Person's tasks'.\
After that, the 'Employee' constructor proceeds to print '3) Performs Employee's tasks'.
Finally, the 'Faculty' constructor prints '(4) Performs Faculty's tasks'.
```
<br/>3. What is the output for the following? Explain.
```java
public class C {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Object[] o = {new A(), new B()};
        System.out.println(o[0]);
        System.out.println(o[1]);
    }
}
    class A extends B {
        public String toString() {
            return "A";
    }
}
    class B {
        public String toString() {
            return "B";
    }
}
```
```
a. AB
In the 'main()' class, array 'Object' is created and initialized with an instance of class 'A' and 'B'.
Both 'toString' method is overridden in both classes 'A' and 'B'.
When the 'toString' method is called on 'o[0]', it returns A, while 'o[1]' returns 'B'.

b. BA
Same as above, the only difference is the placement of which 'toString' method gets called first.
For this instance, 'o[1]' gets called first before 'o[0]', which returns 'B', then 'A'.
  
c. AA
Both 'toString' methods are called on 'o[0]', which returns both outputs as 'A'.

d. BB
Both 'toString' methods are called on 'o[1]', which returns both outputs as 'B'.
```
<br/>4. Write a class definition for an abstract class, Vehicle, that contains:
<br/>• a double instance variable, maxSpeed
<br/>• a protected double instance variable, currentSpeed
<br/>• a constructor accepting a double used to initialize the maxSpeed instance variable
<br/>• an abstract method, accelerate, that accepts no parameters and returns nothing.
<br/>• a method getCurrentSpeed that returns the value of currentSpeed
<br/>• a method getMaxSpeed that returns the value of maxSpeed
<br/>• a method pedalToTheMetal, that repeatedly calls accelerate until the speed of the vehicle
<br/>is equal to maxSpeed. pedalToTheMetal returns nothing.
<br/>Can you create an instance of Vehicle?
  
```java
public abstract class Vehicle {
    public double maxSpeed;
    protected double currentSpeed;

    Vehicle(double maxSpeed) {
        this.maxSpeed = maxSpeed;
    }
    public abstract void accelerate();
    
    public double getCurrentSpeed(){
        return currentSpeed;
    }
    public double getMaxSpeed(){
        return maxSpeed;
    }
    public void pedalToTheMetal(){
        while (currentSpeed < maxSpeed) {
            accelerate();
            System.out.println("Current speed: " + currentSpeed);
        }
        System.out.println("Reached max speed: " + maxSpeed);
    }
}
```
```java
public class Car extends Vehicle{
    public Car(double maxSpeed){
        super(maxSpeed);
    }
    @Override
    public void accelerate(){
        currentSpeed += 10.0;
        if (currentSpeed > maxSpeed){
            currentSpeed = maxSpeed;
        }
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car volvo = new Car(69.42);
        System.out.println("Max speed: " + volvo.getMaxSpeed());
        System.out.println("Current speed: " + volvo.getCurrentSpeed());
        volvo.pedalToTheMetal();
    }
}
```

<br/>5. Assume the existence of an interface, Account, with the following methods:
<br/>• deposit: accepts an integer parameter and returns an integer
<br/>• withdraw: accepts an integer parameter and return a Boolean
<br/>
<br/>Define a class, BankAccount, that implements the above interface and has the following members:
<br/>• an instance variable named balance
<br/>• a constructor that accepts an integer that is used to initialize the instance variable
<br/>• an implementation of the deposit method that adds its parameter to the balance variable. The new balance is returned as the value of the method.
<br/>• an implementation of the withdraw method that checks whether its parameter is less than or equal to the balance and if so,
<br/>  decreases the balance by the value of the parameter and returns true; otherwise, it leaves the balance unchanged and returns false.

```java
public class BankAccount {
    private int balance;
    public BankAccount(int startbal){
        this.balance = startbal;
    }
    public int deposit(int amt){
        balance += amt;
        return balance;
    }
    public boolean withdraw(int amt){
        if(amt <= balance){
            balance -= amt;
            return true;
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }
}
```
```java
public class Account {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BankAccount acc = new BankAccount(1000);
        System.out.println("Starting balance: " + acc.deposit(0));
        System.out.println("Deposit $100, new balance: " + acc.deposit(100));
        System.out.println("Withdraw $200: " + acc.withdraw(200));
        System.out.println("Withdraw $1000: " + acc.withdraw(1000));
        System.out.println("Final balance: " + acc.deposit(200));
    }
}
```
